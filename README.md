# ReinforcementLearning
This repository is an implementation of reinforcment learning techniques that I learn from the course content in FAU and also from youtube.

## Dynamic programming
Dynamic programming (DP) in reinforcement learning (RL) is a method used to find optimal policies in environments modelled as Markov decision processes (MDPs). It involves solving the Bellman equations iteratively to compute the optimal value function or policy. 

In this exercise you will implement important dynamic programming approaches for solving MDPs. You
will use them to solve a simple gridworld MDP
